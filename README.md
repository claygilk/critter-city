# Critter City 2: Rats in the Kitchen

Oh no! It's opening weekend at a new restaurant in the Big City and the entire back-of-house has called off!
Not to worry, the restaurant owner has called on the help of restaurant crew of critters (that's you).
Now it's time to scrounge up some ingredients, flex you're culinary chops and beat the dinner rush.
But be careful, nobody can find out that there is *Rats in the Kitchen!*

## Character Creation

There are four steps to creating your character:

1. Pick a `Critter`. Choose between Rat, Raccoon, Squirrel, Possum, Pigeon, Cat and Coyote.
2. Pick a `Specialty`. Choose a `Skill` from the table below to really good at.
3. Pick a `Vibe`. Choose a `Vibe` from the table below. This will determine what bonus you add to what rolls.
4. Pick a name for your little guy.

## Critters

Different critters are good at different things.
The critter you chose affects what dice you roll for certain `Skills`.
The bigger the dice, the better you are.
If no dice is listed you roll a d8.

## Skills

Whenever you do something difficult roll a `Skill` check by rolling the dice associated with that skill, add your `Vibe` bonus and compare the `Difficulty`.
The `Difficulty` is a number set or rolled by the by the DM (Dinner Master).
If you roll equal to or higher than the `Difficulty` you succeed, roll lower and you fail.
Anything you do boils down to one of these `Skills`:

- `Scare` - Intimidate a `Human` or `Critter`
- `Scrounge` - Search for `Ingredients` or other useful items
- `Scurry` - Avoid danger from `Humans`, `Critters` or the environment
- `Scratch` - Damage a `Human`, `Critter` or object
- `Season` - Finely adjust the flavor taste of a `Dish`
- `Sense` - Detect potential danger
- `Scrub` - Wash dirty `Ingredients` or plates
- `Prep` - Peel, chop, dice or otherwise turn process raw `Ingredients`
- `Pan` - Use human tools to cook a `Dish`
- `Plate` - Arrange a `Dish` in a pleasing manner
- `Plead` - Curry favor from `Humans` or other `Critters`

## Vibes

Your `Vibe` determines your two modifiers: `Critter` and `Cook`.
Your `Critter` modifier is added to any `Skill` check where you are doing something little critters would normally do, such as root through garbage or hiss at someone.
Your `Cook` modifier on the other hand is added to any `Skill` check where you are attempting to do something a human would usually do, such as use cooking utensils or wash dishes.

## Shifts

There are three shifts each day.
There is the `Opening Shift`, `Mid Shift` and `Closing Shift`.
During the `Opening/Closing Shifts` , you can prepare the restaurant for the day ahead or the next day.
You can take a total of **3** actions during an `Opening/Closing Shift`.
Choose any combination of the following:

### Scrounge

---

Pick a location from the table below and roll a `Scrounge` check against the locations `Stock` score.
On a success you gain a number of `Ingredients` equal to the `Stock` of that location.
A second PC (Player Critter) may help `Scrounge` by rolling the `Support Skill` associated with that location.
When receiving `Support` add together both rolls and take the total.

| Location | Stock | Support Skill |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Supermarket|14|Scurry|
|Rival Restaurant|12|Savor|
|Apartment Complex|10|Sense|
|Dumpster|8|Scrub|
|Alley|6|Scare|
|Public Park|4|Plead|
|Sewer|2|Scratch|

### Scrub

---

Make a `Scrub` check. The first time you (or any PC) makes this check in a `Shift` the `Difficulty` is **2**.
Each time a check is passed the `Difficulty` raises to the total you rolled on the successful `Skill` check.
When you pass one of these checks you gain a number of clean `Plates` equal to the difference between your total and the `Difficulty`.
