# Critter City 2: Rats in the Kitchen

Oh no! It's opening weekend at a new restaurant in the Big City and the entire back-of-house has called off!
Not to worry, the restaurant owner has called on the help of restaurant crew of critters (that's you).
Now it's time to scrounge up some ingredients, flex you're culinary chops and beat the dinner rush.
But be careful, nobody can find out that there is *Rats in the Kitchen!*

## Character Creation

There are four steps to creating your character:

1. Pick a `Critter`. Choose between Rat, Raccoon, Squirrel, Possum, Pigeon, Cat and Coyote.
2. Pick a `Specialty`. Choose a `Skill` from the table below to really good at.
3. Pick a `Vibe`. Choose a `Vibe` from the table below. This will determine what bonus you add to what rolls.
4. Pick a name for your little guy.

## Critters

Different critters are good at different things.
The critter you chose affects what dice you roll for certain `Skills`.
The bigger the dice, the better you are.
If no dice is listed you roll a d8.

## Skills

Whenever you do something difficult roll a `Skill` check by rolling the dice associated with that skill, add your `Vibe` bonus and compare the `Difficulty`.
The `Difficulty` is a number set or rolled by the by the DM (Dinner Master).
If you roll equal to or higher than the `Difficulty` you succeed, roll lower and you fail.
Anything you do boils down to one of these `Skills`:

- `Scare` - Intimidate a `Human` or `Critter`
- `Scrounge` - Search for `Ingredients` or other useful items
- `Scurry` - Avoid danger from `Humans`, `Critters` or the environment
- `Scratch` - Damage a `Human`, `Critter` or object
- `Season` - Finely adjust the flavor taste of a `Dish`
- `Sense` - Detect potential danger
- `Scrub` - Wash dirty `Ingredients` or plates
- `Prep` - Peel, chop, dice or otherwise turn process raw `Ingredients`
- `Pan` - Use human tools to cook a `Dish`
- `Plate` - Arrange a `Dish` in a pleasing manner
- `Plead` - Curry favor from `Humans` or other `Critters`

## Vibes

Your `Vibe` determines your two modifiers: `Critter` and `Cook`.
Your `Critter` modifier is added to any `Skill` check where you are doing something little critters would normally do, such as root through garbage or hiss at someone.
Your `Cook` modifier on the other hand is added to any `Skill` check where you are attempting to do something a human would usually do, such as use cooking utensils or wash dishes.

## Shifts

There are three shifts each day.
There is the `Opening Shift`, `Mid Shift` and `Closing Shift`.
During the `Opening/Closing Shifts` , you can prepare the restaurant for the day ahead or the next day.
You can take a total of **3** actions during an `Opening/Closing Shift`.
Choose any combination of the following:

### Scrounge

---

Pick a location from the table below and roll a `Scrounge` check against the locations `Stock` score.
On a success you gain a number of `Ingredients` equal to the `Stock` of that location.
A second PC (Player Critter) may help `Scrounge` by rolling the `Support Skill` associated with that location.
When receiving `Support` add together both rolls and take the total.

| Location | Stock | Support Skill |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Supermarket|14|Scurry|
|Rival Restaurant|12|Savor|
|Apartment Complex|10|Sense|
|Dumpster|8|Scrub|
|Alley|6|Scare|
|Public Park|4|Plead|
|Sewer|2|Scratch|

### Scrub

---

Make a `Scrub` check. The first time you (or any PC) makes this check in a `Shift` the `Difficulty` is **2**.
Each time a check is passed the `Difficulty` raises to the total you rolled on the successful `Skill` check.
When you pass one of these checks you gain a number of `Clean Plates` equal to the difference between your total and the `Difficulty`.

## Mid Shift

The `Mid Shift` is comprised of **5** rounds of being `Open`.
For each round that your restaurant is `Open` you roll once on the **Customer Table** and once on the **Complication Table**.
You can make one `Skill` check each round to either serve a customer or deal with a complication.
If at the end of the 5 rounds no customers are left in the restaurant you move on to the `Closing Shift`.
Otherwise, you continue making `Skill` checks until the all the customers are served or run out of patience.

### Customers

---

In order to survive Opening Weekend you need to make your customers happy.
Customers will rate your restaurant 1 - 3 `Stars` based on the following criteria:

1. `Patience` - Each customer is willing to wait a certain number of rounds for their food. If you deliver the food on time you receive a `Star`.
2. `Presentation` - Certain customers care more about the cleanliness and plating of their food. Each customer has a `Difficulty` for this criteria and if you roll equal to or higher than this `Difficulty` on a `Plate` check then you earn another `Star`.
3. `Profile` - All customers care about the different flavor profiles of your cuisine, but some have a more refined palate than others. Each customer has a `Difficulty` for this criteria that you must match or beat on a `Season` check in order to earn a `Star`.

Each round your restaurant is `Open` roll a **d10** to determine what customer arrives.

| Roll | Customer          | Patience     | Presentation | Profile | Portions     |
| ---  | ---               | ---          | ---          | ---     | ---          |
| 1    | Critic            | 2            | 10           | 12      | 3            |  
| 2    | Karen             | 1            | 7            | 10      | 2            |  
| 3    | Influencer        | 1            | 12           | 9       | 1            |  
| 4    | Kid's Sports Team | # of PCs x 2 | 2            | 3       | # of PCs x 2 |  
| 5    | Family            | # of PCs + 1 | 6            | 8       | # of PCs + 1 |  
| 6    | Couple            | 3            | 9            | 7       | 2            |  
| 7    | Nobody            | -            | -            | -       | -            |  
| 8    | Delivery Driver   | # of PCs     | 2            | 6       | # of PCs     |  
| 9    | A Regular         | 3            | 4            | 4       | 1            |  
| 10   | Stoner            | 4            | 2            | 2       | 3            |  

### Fulfilling Orders

---

In order to fulfill a customers order you must prepare a finished `Dish` of the requested `Portion` size.
`Raw Ingredients` can be converted into `Prepped Ingredients` by making a `Prep` check. 
The `Difficulty` of the check is determined by how many `Ingredients` you attempt to prep in a single round.
Pick a number and the `Difficulty` is that number multiplied by **3**.

`Prepped Ingredients` can be made into `Portions` with a successful `Pan` check.
Again, the `Difficulty` of this check is **3** times the number of `Portions` being prepared.

Once all the `Portions` have been made a `Season` check is made to prepare the determine the `Profile` score of the `Dish`. 
If the `Season` roll is greater than or equal to the orders `Profile Difficulty` one `Star` is earned.

Lastly, before serving a `Plate` check must be made against the orders `Presentation Difficulty`.
Meeting or beating this `Difficulty` earns you a `Star`.
Failed `Plate` checks can be rerolled by spending a `Clean Plate` resource.

After serving the order, write down the number of `Stars` you earned.
These will determine your final score at the end of the game.

### Complications

---

During each round of the `Mid Shift` roll a **d20** to determine what complication happens.
Each complication is represented by a single noun that is meant to be a prompt for creativity and roll play.
It is up to the DM to determine the specifics of each complication what `Skill` checks are required to defuse the situation.
