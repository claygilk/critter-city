# Critter City 2: Rats in the Kitchen!

Oh no! It's opening weekend at a new restraunt in the Big City and the entire back-of-house has called off!
Not to worry, the restraunt owner has called on the help of capabale crew of critters (that's you).
Now it's time to scrounge up some ingredients, flex you're culinary chops and beat the dinner rush.
But be careful, nobody can find out that there is **Rats in the Kitchen!**
